                <div label='How does solar energy work?'>
                    <p>In residential projects, the Sunâ€™s energy is harnessed through the use of photovoltaic (PV) technology. A solar panel is a collection of silicon PV cells that absorb sunlight to produce electricity through the Photovoltaic Effect. This electricity can be used to immediately power the home, or be reserved in a battery storage system for future use. </p>

                <div label='What are the different types of solar systems?'>
                    <p>There are three primary residential solar PV and storage installations:</p>
                    <p><strong>Solar</strong> installations include solar panels providing energy for immediate use. Any unused energy captured by panels is lost.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solar + Battery</strong> installations use a home battery system to store excess energy captured during hours of sunlight to allow for use during periods of minimal or no sun exposure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Off-grid</strong> systems serve as stand alone power systems where homes are entirely self-sufficient and do not rely on the electrical grid at all. </p>
